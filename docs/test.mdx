## Overview
Vivids are rare forms of Voidpets that can come in multiple color variations. There are 16 total variants with each being twice as rare as the one before. The concept of vividness is heavily borrowed from the Pokémon series and functions similarly. Vivids, like shiny Pokémon are only cosmetic and have no advantage in battle over regular Voidpets. 

Here is an image of all vivid variants:

*Note: You can also use [voidpet tools](https://voidpet.io) to see the variants of all Voidpets.*

## Gameplay Uses
Currently, there are quests or gameplay requirements that demand the player to catch a vivid.

## Identifying a Vivid

### Wild Voidpets
Wild Voidpets will always have a 10% chance of being vivid. This chance does not change for different voidpet species. The variant will be visible in the overworld and players do not have to interact with the pet to check if it is vivid.

### Starter Voidpets
A player's starter pet will have a 10% chance of being vivid but will appear as a normal voidpet until bond level 3 is reached. It is possible to check a pet's variant before bond level 3 by finding the variant number in the pet's code or using the [voidpet tools](https://voidpet.io) website.
